    "reviewDescription": "Terrible treatment on a business class flight from Washington DC to Heathrow when we were seated separately when the plane type changed and request to change seating at check in and with cabin crew was refused, leaving me distressed (I am a nervous flyer) Compounded by atrocious customer service when we complained. It has taken 4 months and a lot of effort on our part to get a refund for the money paid to choose our seats. Plus when we complained about the treatment by cabin crew and lack of care about my distress we were sent an e-voucher as an \"apology\", and they refused to give cash instead so the apology is empty as we won't be flying with BA again now",

    "reviewDescription": "I have been trying to obtain a receipt for BA flights taken in Nov/Dec 24 and am getting nowhere. I have raised 2 x cases with BA, the first sat with BA for 3 weeks before being closed without resolution and the second has sat at 'received' for over a week with no progress. Having waited for live chats with a real person the live chats 'mysteriously' have been disconnected forcing me to start all over again.\nMy request for a receipt is pretty simple, if BA cannot get this right I dread to think how the rest of the business is being run.\nI was once a fan of BA but current performance is making it NOT the world's favourite airline!",

    "reviewDescription": "Came here to write a one star review, and I'm not surprised in the slightest to see a horrifically poor rating for British Airways. It's so low, the kind of low you see for scam websites.\n\nMy first and last experience is due to the fact that they cancelled our flights that were due to depart on Boxing Day. They gave us no alternative carriers that we could fly with. I had to get a refund and fly with a different operator. With it being so much closer to Christmas we had to pay \u00a32000 extra for our flights.\n\nI started a complaint with BA but have been effectively ignored. Completed ghosted. I shall be complaining externally about this terrible organisation but either way, I'll never travel with them again. I hope they go bust.",

I am not quick to complain but this is just the kind of behaviour of a company that will make sure customers will not support them in the future. I may be one of them.",

    "reviewDescription": "I paid \u00a34000+ for one week in Malaga for two people - flights and hotel.\nOriginal flight was cancelled at short notice. The next flight was delayed by over 6 hours with no communication from BA whatsover. The above was only a small part of the problem and can be excused slightly as the weather was to blame.\nHowever, it was our arrival at the hotel and our treatment that I was shocked and dismayed about.\nDue to the delay, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 1am\nWe were told that our whole booking had been cancelled by BA.\nEventually, after paying 690 euros, we were given a tiny noisy room for 1 night and made aware that under no uncertain terms would there be a room available for the rest of the holiday.\nNext morning, after multiple phone calls to BA, we were found a large sea view room, which we had already paid for and lost 2 nights in.\nI requested BA refund for these 2 nights but was gobsmacked to be told - No -\nThey refused further discussion on the matter and to my horror I have since found out they are not ABTA protected.\nIn fact they have no resolution solutions at all. They are a law unto themselves.\nBuyer beware - all is great until there's a hiccup when they will reveal themselves to be the most vicious, money grabbing and uncaring travel company you will ever come across. Do not book unless you can afford to lose a lot of money.\n",

    "reviewTitle": "This started with a cancelled flight",
    "reviewDescription": "This started with an email stating that my return flight from Barbados had been cancelled. No explanation and no offer of help. The advice was just check their website to rebook or claim a refund. Three weeks before I was supposed to fly out, a refund was of no use due to expensive accommodation bookings. The only flight on offer was 24 hours later. When rebooking, they even made me pay for seat selection again when I had already done this on the original booking. This was later refunded.\nOn my return home I lodged a claim for reimbursement of additional expenses, hotel. food and taxis but the website is not easy to navigate to find out what they pay and how to lodge the claim.\n10 weeks later the status of the claim is simply ''received'' in other words no-one has progressed the claim. 10 weeks of inaction.\nGeneral customer service cannot access the claims process, all they say is that the team are very busy. They cannot provide a contact number to speak to the team so the customer is left entirely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service and accountability.\nLike some of the other contributers, I think I have made my last booking with BA.\n",

    "reviewDescription": "Dear OWNERS of British Airlines\n\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding a recent experience with British Airways that I found to be quite disappointing.\n\nFlight BA 0552 of January 12, 2025\n\nIn my experience, the level of service provided was far below what one would expect from a reputable airline. Specifically, I encountered a significant delay during BA0552 flight, which was exacerbated by a lengthy crew replacement process that took two hours, followed by an additional 1.5 hours for flight attendant replacement.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, I found the staff to be unhelpful and, at times, rude. There was a notable lack of clear and honest communication regarding the reasons for the delay, leaving passengers feeling frustrated and uninformed.\n\nGiven these experiences, I regret to say that I no longer view British Airways as a premium airline. Instead, I perceive it to be more akin to a budget carrier in terms of service quality.\n\nI recommend that potential passengers consider using your airline only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nI would like particularly like to highlight the behaviour of Chief Flight Attendants MR. INCOGNITO who was especially rude and dismissive towards to passengers!\n\nI hope you take this feedback into consideration as you strive to improve your services.\nPassenger Seat 2A\n",
