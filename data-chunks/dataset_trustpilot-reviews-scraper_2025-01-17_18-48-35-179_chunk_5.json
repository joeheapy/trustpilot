    "reviewTitle": "British Airways should leave the service industry",
    "reviewDescription": "We had a flight from Newcastle -> London -> Delhi with everything arranged, web checkin done and we booked good seats.\nDue to the first flight delay, we did not make the second flight. We were given a flight 7 hours later with separate middle seats, far apart from each other but this had a knock on effect of missing our hotel stay and car and driver that had been arranged in India.\nI was going to India for my wedding and missed my wedding dress fitting appointment also.\nWe were very upset and thought we would get a cup of tea as we both had headaches from the waiting and commotion but the queue at the cafe was so long that we decided to go to the BA lounge to sit down. I was feeling very dizzy and nauseated. My partner said to the receptionist called Av that if he could get the manager while we settle down.\nAv asked us for the tickets and then mocked us seeing the \u2018economy class\u2019 which was given to us as the only option by BA. I can\u2019t express my disgust at the way he smirked and let out a laugh seeing the tickets. When I confronted him, he asked me for further details which I did provide and added the issues I was facing due to a pounding headache to which his response was \u201care you going to answer me straight forward or not?\u201d. He threatened to take us off the flight several times if we didn\u2019t move.\nWe both collapsed on the floor near the door due to being drained of all this and bad head ache.\nThe manager Caroline Sawyer came and announced straight away that we should get up and leave ignoring our condition. They didn\u2019t ask us once about our health, they didn\u2019t care about spoiling my onward wedding plans which had to be all rearranged, they didn\u2019t care at all about spoiling my start of the beautiful journey for my destination wedding.\nInfact she threatened us to call the police and have us removed from the flight again and report at the gate to be monitored.\nWe left and went for a tea and sandwich. They had given us a voucher of \u00a310 each. The cost of two tea and one sandwich and two packets of crips came to \u00a320.95.\nAlthough we were going to wait 7hours, they didn\u2019t provide us water or any other comfort.\nBecause they only have a relationship with virgin Atlantic and air Canada. They would not put us on an afternoon flight on air India even though it was available.\nI wish I had not made this mistake of booking BA for my big day plan.\nIt\u2019s humiliating and embarrassing even to talk to them. They talk to you as if they are God and we are peasants. I think it\u2019s safe to say we had an experience of being with corporate bullies and in easier terms a dictatorship.\nTheir threats were appalling. Their treatment towards a sick person was deplorable. Their poor attitude added to my stress and caused me more dizziness.\nThey should leave the service industry.",

    "reviewDescription": "Last 2 flights lost all bags. This flight get me in to Heathrow T5 and I have a connection. 45mins to make outside same terminal. Than a get a completely horrible woman who says you won't back that flight gonand stand in this huge line. We said we can still make the original flight but she had her little bit of power and she was loving it. I said look can you just let us go and we can have a go at making this? She then said I was annoying her which really pleased me so she then call the security balloons. They asked what I was doing? I told them nothing speak to the head dispatcher as she seen herself. So now we have a 3hr wait while that person looks on laughing as of she has won't some big moral victory. She is noting bit a small slow minded individual who should be fires for her shocking service. I keep saying to more BAs BS and this time I'm done. I'll take KLM or American. They won't be worse than this shower of small minded morons. ADIOD BA after 30yrs",

    "reviewTitle": "An update and warning for those waiting for compensation and refunds from BA",
    "reviewDescription": "A further update to the one posted 2 days ago which will likely affect others waiting for compensation and refunds from BA.\nDue to a technical fault with the aircraft BA cancelled my flight from LHR to SFO on Dec 20th. This resulted in a 21 hour delay and a journey lasting over 40 hours.\nOK, things can go wrong when traveling, that\u2019s just part of experience if you travel often enough. When that happens, what is important is how the airline\u2019s customer services treat you. In this regard I\u2019ve been both shocked and appalled by BA\u2019s response.\nAfter trying 23 times over several days to contact BA Customer Services when I was repeatedly cut off by BA due them having a \u2018high call volume\u2019, I finally managed to speak to someone. The response I received was unbelievable.\nI asked about the status of my claim and why BA had not communicated anything to me and why BA had automatically closed my claim when I later checked the BA app. I was told \u201csorry I can\u2019t help you, that department is not operational at the moment\u201d. When I asked when it would be operational and how long it would take to process my claim, I was informed \u201csomeone from that department should contact you in the next 2 to 3 months\u201d. Not days, not weeks, months!\nWhen making a booking with BA they require immediate payment, when BA owes the customer money they take 3 months. I cannot even begin to comprehend the degree of contempt BA must have for its customers.\nI wish BA would have its landing slots at Heathrow revoked and given to a more competent operator. I\u2019m sure Virgin, Easy Jet or even Ryanair would do a much better job.\n",

Although I managed to get home the new flight cost more than I was \u2018refunded.\u2019 I was not seeking compensation for the stress and inconvenience caused or the extra expense that the charge of flight incurred. However,I did ask for the difference in the cost between the two flights. Three months after my request and constant thanks for \u2018waiting for an answer,\u2019 I was told on Christmas Day that their records show I had been given a full refund. This means that in all that time my request had been ignored/rejected and sidelined like so many others! This is not about the money but customer care and listening.",
