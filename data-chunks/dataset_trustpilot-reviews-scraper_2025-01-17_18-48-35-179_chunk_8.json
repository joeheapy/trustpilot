I am even unsure if I will keep the Silver Status for the usual 12/15 months which used to be the case. What a bad timing for me - just the moment I reached the Silver; BA changed their rules after many decades. I am seriously considering to fly with other airlines now after flying with BA for almost 33 years! Insult to injury for my loyalty. Truly heartbroken. Shame on BA!",

    "reviewDescription": "I hope British Airways reads and passes on reviews but I am sceptical. This one is for the pilot of BA 212 departing 31/12/24 BOS-LHR. The landing on the morning of 01/01/25 at LHR was immaculate. And I mean immaculate. I have flown millions of miles. The wind was treacherous, the wings seesawing up and down right up to the moment of touchdown. The pilot timed his touch down so perfectly the wheels all touched at the same time and the plane stayed straight as an arrow (787 is not a small plane!). Barely felt a thing. No bumps at all.\n\nPilots do not get enough credit. This Captain executed to a standard he should be proud of.\n\nBritish Airways have ruined their product over the past decade and have hurt their staff with contract changes, however they manage to retain well educated, well spoken and highly competent pilots. Well done and thank you to our pilot.",

    "reviewDescription": "Flew BA for our honeymoon, and they messed up so much of it that we missed a day of our honeymoon and faced expenses as a result that they refuse compensate us for. What\u2019s worse than that is that theyve taken no responsibility and refused to communicate about complaints any other way than on email, and yet won\u2019t respond to emails either. I feel like the government needs to regulate this sector to prevent scam airlines like BA from swindling customers and force them to take responsibility. They have ridden on their brand equity they\u2019ve built in previous decades for too long and unfortunately for them they\u2019ve used up all of the public\u2019s good will and faith in them. Now with the latest changes to the points system they will only deal with business flyers, perhaps that\u2019s the aim!",

My 7 year old autistic son was assaulted by James, a member of your cabin crew on board the flight from Islamabad to Gatwick airport nearly 3 weeks ago. You still have not replied to my email. I suggest you take this very seriously unless you would like me to take this to the papers and upload it all over social media. To be honest I\u2019m more tempted to upload my video over TikTok than report this to the police, maybe that will get your attention.",

But wow, the customer support both at Heathrow or remote is either no existent or be as well.... zero help, getting passed from department to another, it is truly frustrating experience. I've been trying to get a refund, that is owed for seat downgrading of whole family, since October 18th and despite trying to contact BA, I have yet to receive the refund owed or even get an update on the status (despite following the online guidance) This once great airline is now in the 3rd Division of Airlines and to be honest be as well moving aside and letting a proper Airline company run the business.",
