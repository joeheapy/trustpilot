    "reviewTitle": "BA worst airline in the WORLD!!",
    "reviewDescription": "I want to understand why I can\u2019t rate the as 0. 1 is a huge overrating for this clown company. I was a gold card holder 7 years ago and would only fly BA. Last year they cancelled my return flight whilst on holiday with my whole family with 10 days notice. 6 months later they have just declined our compensation as we had to pay our \u00a32000 for replacement flights, extra nights accommodation, extra day car hire. Their reason: they cancelled the flight for \u2018Commercial Reasons\u2019!!!!! So why do I foot the bill for their commercial issues?!?!?! These clowns may think I will leave it here but rest assured I will take this to ombudsman followed by legal firms AND I will be claiming every single penny I am entitled too. I really hope that at some point a Class Action is brought against BA as you can read thousands of similar experiences online and they seem to get away with their inept customer service and ability to stress customers for 6-12 months as I can ill afford \u00a32000 on top of my holiday cost for reasons that an airline simply cancelled my flight and provided no alternative leaving me to book a replacement. The final point of note was that I booked a Vueling flight (which they told me they could not transfer me too as they had no agreement with the airline) AND wait for it, the payment on my statement for that flight went to BRITISH AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! \ud83e\udd21",

    "reviewTitle": "Very disappointing flight",
    "reviewDescription": "The staff were really arrogant, not friendly and engaging at all, it almost seems as if they just want to get you out of the way feed you and that's it. They did not engage cat all, asked if you wanted o eat and moved on, the male cabin crew that was serving in economy needs customer service training really. I asked for a drink and he said yes he will bring it, waited and waited after 20 minutes asked again from another cabin crew and also was told they will bring it, the flight ended and had still did not get my drink. I was very disappointed. This was my first time flying with British airways have never used him before and I fly at least 5 times a year for both business and lesure. Hope this was a once off and that this was just a bad day for the crew.\nThe food is really horrible especially after spending \u00a31800 on a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg i expected better much better for an airlines as big as British airways. The dinner i opened had a look and closed it straight away, went hungry and looked forward to breakfast. Then recieved the breakfast and did the same opened and closed it not good at all. A least i managed to eat the fruit.\nThe seat space is really uncomfortable, with theatre table beant the trays were sliding off.\nNot sure if anyone will call me the after care service normally never happens. My flight number was BA57 on 2nd January 2025.\n\nI am flying tonight again 12th January 2025 BA 56 hope his will be different after trying to upgrade my seat to a window seat and not able to, get to the end and dies not allowed me to make a payment and the seat was available. Eventually when I managed the seat was gone. Really disappointing.\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n",

    "reviewDescription": "I spent a considerable amount of time on the phone attempting to resolve a booking for my family holiday. Over the course of four separate occasions, I had to speak with four different members of staff, each time enduring a queue of over 40 minutes.\n\nWhat I found particularly frustrating was that each representative provided entirely different costs and calculations, despite being given the same points and voucher information.\n\nMoreover, I found the tone and attitude of the staff to be unacceptably arrogant, even though I made every effort to remain polite throughout the interactions.\n\nIn contrast, when I contacted Virgin Atlantic, I was thoroughly impressed with how professionally and efficiently they handled my calls. Their customer service was exemplary, and their offerings were notably more competitive compared to British Airways.\n\n",

I was being mis informed, gaslit and lied to just kept being ansked to wait annd they would anssure me it would be resolved, I wait annd call back annd it\u2019s an different story. absolutely horrible customer service. How in one phone call I\u2019m getting told 3 different things. I was even told I would get a call back from a manager on 3 occasions, I was the one calling this company. I called around 20 times in total only to find out I\u2019m being gaslit the entire time. I filed a complaint on their website and all they do is offer me \u00a350 voucher? Wtf am I gonna do with that when my flight was \u00a3300. British airways can sk itself sideways.",

Looks like there is no monitoring of their services or behaviour. Food was poor and inadequate, and so were the facilities and entertainment for a long-haul flight. Budget airlines would do a better job. At the end of the journey, we wanted to find something positive to write. But there wasn't anything.",

    "reviewDescription": "Following a grueling journey from EDI to AKL and back again during which time my checked bag was lost twice I cannot reccomend this airline.\n\nRegarding the airline itself, none of the four flights I took with them (half of which were over 8 hours in length) were on time. The first was over an hour late resulting in me being rebooked The second (which left before I arrived, but somehow carried one of my bags?) was an hour earlier than when I booked it. The third, due to a broken groundside air conditioner was also delayed, much of which saw me sweating my trecherous life away on a sweltering plane, that were it to just take off would be so much colder. The final flight was also a tad early, and was also missed due to a couple hours of delay.\n\nBeyond this, they lost my bag. Their website was repeatedly down due to \"high demandm,\" generally sluggish, and the section for tracking my bag was hidden through several confusingly titled links.\n\nBritish Airways desperately needs to get their act together, I have had worse experiences flying, but not many.\n\n",
