    "reviewDescription": "We flew from Edinburgh to London Heathrow and connected from London Heathrow to Rome. Got on the plane at Edinburgh and two people decided that they didn\u2019t want to fly. Delayed whilst they got their cases off. The conveyor belt broke down whilst they were doing this. Waited on an engineer coming eventually arrived fixed that we missed our slot. Eventually arrived into Heathrow and met at the gate given a ticket to say our next flight was at 7pm given a \u00a310 meal voucher with a 7 hour delay ahead of us, wouldn\u2019t even buy you a sandwich and a drink. Told to go to customer services. There was an earlier flight at 2pm ish we asked if we couldn\u2019t get on? My son looked on line and we could buy 4 tickets on that flight despite being told there was no seats and showing the lady the flights on his phone. Told we should go to the gate at that time and they would see what they could do, we never got on. Our original flight from Edinburgh was 8.05 arrive London Heathrow 9.35 leave Heathrow 11.50 arrive Rome 15.25. So over two hours between flights. This happened on the 21st June, they did eventually after several emails back and forth with my son who claimed for 4 of us. They admitted they were liable for compensation this was 11th January 2025 and asked for my sons bank details. He sent them and reminded them that there was 4 of us. They then emailed back to say they weren\u2019t paying compensation we had plenty of time to catch our flight and all they would pay was the extra taxi fare we had to get. It was after midnight when we eventually arrived in Rome. To say BA are one of the best airlines to travel with and this is the shoddy treatment we have received is beyond me. You can\u2019t speak to anyone, I think nearly an 8 month wait is unreasonable and BA should be ashamed of themselves. I personally think your just going to get fed up and go away!! Well I can tell you BA we are NOT going away and we will continue to fight for what we are owed.",

I was told I could no longer have the seats, they didn\u2019t explain why just put me into a regular seat with poor legroom, I was informed that I could claim my money back once I had returned to the UK.\n\nI put in my claim when I returned in October 2024, and received an email giving me a case number and telling me that it will be dealt with as soon as possible. I have now been waiting almost 3 months for my money back, I\u2019ve contacted them on numerous occasions only to be told that it\u2019s in a queue And that I can\u2019t speak to the relevant department who deals with this. Today, I tried using the chat line who couldn\u2019t understand a word I was saying as it\u2019s obviously a robot. I spent 25 minutes trying to get my point across with no help whatsoever and I can\u2019t find a telephone number where I can talk to the relevant people dealing with my claim. VERY POOR SERVICE!",

    "reviewTitle": "British Airways happy to 'steal' from customers! Appalling treatment!",
    "reviewDescription": "I am appalled at the despicable way in which British Airways have behaved! I am absolutely angry, upset, frustrated and fed up with the seeming impossibility and inability of BA staff to arrange for me to book a seat for a cello alongside a passenger! They have effectively stolen \u00a376 from me and are refusing to refund this! I have been waiting to be contacted by a manager, since mid- November and have now given up, hence posting this review!\nBA's procedure for booking a cello seat is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS and near impossible:\nOn 13th November 2024 I called BA to book a seat for my son and a seat for his cello, to travel from UK to Austria. I have booked seats twice before with BA and know from these experiences that rather than simply booking two seats online (as with any other airline he has travelled with!) that BA require that a cello seat has to be booked separately to the passenger seat, via a phone call.\nWhen I called to book a seat for the cello, I was first told I could simply book 2 seats via the BA website. I was very surprised and asked the staff member if this was correct. I was told this was the case, and felt relieved that BA must have changed their rules. However I decided to check...... I googled BA\u2019s website and discovered that this information was in fact incorrect. When I mentioned this, the staff member first disagreed...and then checked.. and told me that I did in fact need to book the cello seat on the phone!! It was very surprising that this person did not know the rules and had I not known this from previous experience, I would have bought an incorrect ticket which apparently would not have been accepted at the airport!\nI was then told I needed to book a seat for my son first, and that once I had a reference number, to call back to arrange for a seat for the cello. I did this and I used a BA voucher to pay for the flight for my son: Booking JRQEJZ.\nWhen I called back to ask for the additional seat, I was told that a form had to first be submitted to apply for the seat. I made it very clear that we definitely needed a seat for the cello as it was not allowed legally, for this cello to be placed in the hold. The staff member then said they had submitted the form and that I would be contacted by email a day or two later, and should at that point call back to pay for the seat.\nTwo days later, on 15th Nov I received and email asking me to contact BA about my booking. I called back only to be told that the form had somehow not been properly submitted and needed to be submitted again, I was again told to call back 24 to 48 hours later. I called again on 16th and was told there was still no decision about the cello seat and that I should call again in 24-72 hours. My son was due to fly in LESS than 72 hours and this felt like an impossible situation!!!!\nThe staff members that I spoke to did not seem at all sympathetic, caring, or even concerned that I had spent four days, not to mention many, many hours of being on hold, that I was getting nowhere and still did not know if the seat would be granted or not!! Their entire attitude was as if they didn\u2019t care at all about their customers!!\nAgain, I called back a day later \u2013 17th Nov in the evening and at that point was told that my son could not have a seat for the cello but would have to book it into the hold, despite me having expressly stated that this was not safe for an old cello and also was not legally allowed for his instrument to go in the hold!!! I stated that I knew it was possible to take the cello on a seat, as we had done this on two previous occasions without problem, however, I was simply repeatedly told that cellos cannot go on seats and must go into the hold. If this is the case, why was I not told this? It makes no sense, as on BA\u2019s website it states:\n\u201cYour cello can travel next to you in the cabin in an additional seat. You\u2019ll need to buy this seat specifically for your cello when you book your flight, or at least 48 hours before you travel, subject to availability.\nAt this point, I had only a few hours to find a new flight for my son and his cello, in order that he could return on 18th. I was also in the position of having purchased a seat for my son for \u00a376, which I ONLY purchased because I was told by BA staff that in order to apply for a cello seat, I HAD TO 1ST PURCHASE A SEAT and obtain a booking reference number!!! I would never have purchased this seat if I had known from the start that they were to refuse the cello!!! When I asked for this cost to be refunded I was repeatedly told that this was not possible! I consider this akin to stealing this money from me!! I then spoke with Swalia, a manager who said she would look into this for me and contact me. I am still waiting and have heard nothing. I am beyond upset and consider that BA not only do not care about their customers, but are happy to steal from them!\nThey obviously do not want to have musicians travel with them.\nAvoid at all costs!",

    "reviewDescription": "What a joke of a company. Talk about destroying what was once a major UK brand to be proud of. Don't know where to start.... let's start at the beginning, their website when trying to book. Glitches and crashes constantly, and repeatedly asking for the same information. Customer Service is another pathetic offering. I've been unable to change a return flight online, can't do it through chat, and via the telephone number for the past 3 days I get 'we're taking large volumes of calls at the moment so please try again later' 3 days!!!!. The value of Avios points have diminished over the years are becoming worthless now, and often unusable. In flight experience isn't much better, with poor staff attitude, forcing passengers to line up for boarding the plane isn't ready to boarding, just to meet timing quotas, smaller legroom in economy than some of the budget airlines, and European business class, no more than a free middle seat, and a drink and a rather tasteless lunch offering. Sean Doyle the CEO, you should hang your head in shame. Maybe take sometime looking at your competitors such as Virgin, Qatar and Emirates, who clearly know how to deliver world class service and treat their customers with dignaty and respect. BA's decline started over 20 odd years ago and continues to this day. Get back to basics, start with investing in customer service, stop gouging for every penny, recreate loyalty. You're lucky you have the Heathrow slots, otherwise you'd be destroyed by the competition.\n\nFollow up note the day after the review above - BA website and customer service centre down today...'\"call back in 2 hours and maybe it will be sorted\"... gets better!!!!!",

    "reviewDescription": "I went to book flights using my airmiles to discover that my account had been hacked. I called BA who said someone had changed the email address, they would freeze the account and come back to me in 2 weeks. 2 weeks later I called for progress to find they wouldn\u2019t talk to me as wrong email address after over 1 hour of arguing they believed me. Said the previous agent should have changed the email address so would send me a link and it would take 72 hours to change! I questioned the hackers having access to my account and they said as 2 factor authentication no problem. I asked them for the mobile number on the account and the hackers had changed that too. I managed to change the email address back and then received an email with an email trail from Jonathan on 9/12/24 where he had emailed the hackers saying there was suspicious activity on the account and airmiles had been stolen. So BA had emailed the hackers where they still had access to my account! I chased this, pointed this out and asked for an investigation to the data breach only to receive an email to say my airmiles had been reinstated and case closed! I\u2019ve called 3 times to be told I need to speak to Newcastle but everytime I call I get put through to India and there is no number for Newcastle so I\u2019m told to raise a complaint online. I\u2019ve filled out a case complaint 3 times and no one has come back to me. Serious data breach, I\u2019ve had to book the flights I wanted with to book with my airmiles paying cash with another airline as by the time they sorted the issue they said would take 2 weeks ended up taking 6 weeks so the flights were gone. I would like BA to come back to me on this before this data breach is reported.",

I\u2019ve spent over 70 days arguing and proving to BA that the flight was cancelled but due to the special way that BA control the customer complaints department, you can\u2019t speak to the person or department dealing with it. You have to call the customer\u2018helpline\u2019 which is far from helpful. They have no power, won\u2019t put you through to the correct people, claim that they can\u2019t call Loganair or look on Manchester airports historic flight website to see that the flight was cancelled in fact they do very little! They can\u2019t even put you on to their supervisor! I have now had apparent confirmation that they finally agree that the flight was cancelled and have promised a refund but that will take a further 10 days. Avoid this shower like the plague!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Flying back from Schipol in The\u2026",
    "reviewDescription": "Flying back from Schipol in The Netherlands to London City. I got to the airport a few hours early, went to the BA check-in desk, and asked if I could change to one of the two flights before the one I am booked on, and how much would it cost to switch. Same departure and arrival airports. I was told that couldn't even look into that for me, and I needed to call a BA customer service number. When did airlines decide that you couldn't even discuss the simplest of changes to travel plans in person at the airport? So, I called BA, eventually got through to an agent, explained what I was looking to do and asked for the the price to change. After a few minutes checking he told me that yes, I could switch to the earliest available flight. As he didn't tell me how much I assumed it would be free, or a minimal charge. After another five minutes he had successfully moved me to the earliest flight, then informed me it would cost \u00a3139, which is essentially the cost of buying a new ticket. Memo to BA - as part of your customer service training, if there is such a thing, have the agents inform the passenger of any price implications before changing the booking, not after. I said I didn't want to proceed at that cost, he told me he had in the meantime removed me from my original flight, so I would have to re-check in at the airport desk. I went back to the desk, and was told my entire booking had been cancelled, and that I was \"no longer travelling\". After I expressed my disappointment at that particular nugget of information, a supervisor came over and eventually I was back to where I started, with a ticket for my original flight. Only half an hour of my time wasted, with some unnecessary annoyance. I subsequently went to the boarding gate to see if I could be allowed on one of the earlier flights, and was told this was \"not possible\". I am quite sure it is possible, BA just actively hates their customers, and rather than allowing for a simple accommodation, that would inconvenience literally no one, and would mean I got home to my family two hours early, they chose to say no. Well done BA, really well done. Alex Henderson BA member (for now) 40780277",

    "reviewTitle": "Never again \u2026 an abysmal airline",
    "reviewDescription": "We had a BA overnight flight to and from Heathrow to Johannesburg (out Dec 24 back Jan 25) and it was a complete nightmare. Both planes were filled with business class seats with economy crammed in at the final third of the plane, the space allocated to an economy seat is abysmal, so uncomfortable and a tight squeeze getting in and out, even when empty of people! The seats hardly recline and are more uncomfortable when reclined but the worst part is the seat itself, no padding at all, I suffer from sciatica but even my husband who does not found the seats impossible they were so hard with no padding. This is not acceptable on such a long flight. I was in agony on both flights. The cabin was so warm and on this plane those adjustable tiny fans above your head do not exist. The food too was horrible, pasta with tomato sauce only! The worst bit however was the return flight, we landed (with numerous excuses from the captain about a fault on the plane which personally I find scary) only to be left sitting on the boiling hot plane for a further 1.5 hours because there were no bus drivers to take us from the plane to the terminal. Our flight cost more than \u00a31100 each, we will never fly BA again.",

    "reviewDescription": "I hardly ever do reviews and I felt that I had to review the flight I took from Heathrow to Madrid on 10/01/2025 at 7.25am.\nThe Captain (Gary) was apologetic and kept us well informed as we were 1.5 hours late taking off (due to issues in Madrid, not Heathrow). ALL of the staff were in a good mood and so polite and helpful. Diego gave me some recommendations of where to go and what to eat in Madrid. I was taking my friend to Madrid as she had turned 50 two days before and I told the cabin staff this and they opened us a bottle of champagne and gave it to us for free, in glasses. They made sure we was happy throughout and my friend and I thought it was such a lovely touch (we were only in economy) that it really set the mood for our trip. So thank you to Diego, Olivia and I think her name was Nahum for looking after us at the back. Also to Gary who came to see us at the end of our flight and shook our hands. Its not often airline staff get praise but we felt they deserved it.",
