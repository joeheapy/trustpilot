Dont be fooled by the gaslighting people.\n\nthe spend tiers announced are before tax. Reality is we will all now have to fly (for example) at least 15 flights (avg. \u00a3280 per flight) a year to only qualify for Bronze. 30+ flighst on same working for silver!!!!\n\nDespite my loyal custom and travelling over 300,000 miles with BA in the last 17 years, now i cant even get bronze! No point sticking with BA anymore!\n\nI guess many of us with avois were looking for a reason to leave this airline. Great news for EasyJet etc.",

The gas lighting from the company is beyond out of this world! Any rewards for long term loyalty for this overpriced poor service Arline are now well and truly gone! As soon as my exec club card runs out... i like many others, am outa here!\n\nWell done BA!",

I am owed for a hold bag that my daughter was charged for at the return airport despite me having paid for a hold bag 3 weeks earlier on line. It has now been 3 months and no information whatsoever regarding the progress of my claim, despite numerous emails and conversations with Customer Relations. The amount owed is not really the issue its the terrible service which will stop me using BA in the future.",

    "reviewDescription": "I can't believe what used to be the crown jewels can be so poorly rated by most of it's customers. I've always enjoyed flying BA. Maybe 25 years with the exec club. Gold Guestlist for a while. Only Silver now as I've been focusing on the UK market with my work recently.\n\nI booked a trip to Japan Dec '25 with my 2 young children. As I used Companion Voucher and Barclays Upgrade I was asked to make 2 separate bookings as the system couldn't handle it. I obliged. I was then told to seat my children next to me I'd have to pay. I complained and they offered me \u00a3100 off (so maybe pay over \u00a3300 for the fact the system couldn't cope with my request).\n\nI sent in a written complaint. Obviously no reply as there's so many fires to put out.\n\nI enquired about switching to Qatar airways club today. Think I'll leave and take my 1 million Avios with me.",

My flight BA0493 was delayed for more than 4 hours, and when we got to our destination they left our baggage at the airport!!! What an absolute disaster of an airline, I paid more money to fly on a BA flight over easyjet thinking the service would be better by my god it is the worst customer service i have ever experienced period.\n\nThis flight delay occurred in Jul 2024. We are now in Jan 2025 after i have put in a case and made multiple complaints, they still have not got back to me and every time i call I get there is nothing we can do and you need to contact complaint department. guess what complaints department cant be contacted except via email! and i still have never got a response. I literally have no clue where to go other than a claims solicitor. I hope this company can turn it around.",

They did a longer search to find out i am meant to be on it but (BRITISH AIRWAYS DIDNT INFORM JETSTAR) so they let me on a later flight instead of my orignal one.\n\nI contacted british airways during my holiday in australia over email, to then recieve \u00a350 voucher (WHAT WAS VALID FOR 1 DAY WHAT WAS NOT MY RETURN FLIGHT DAY)\nI emailed back asking why its not dated for my return as i'm not flying anywhere for this date you gave the voucher for...Up to today i'm still waiting for a email reply.\n\nPicture Proof attcahed of the email.\n\nDuring that covid December when all flights got canceled, I was creditded the value of the flight to be used up to September, It was done through a 3rd party company (THAT TOOK THEIR TIME TO GET A EVOUCHER FROM THE AIRLINE TO GIVE TO ME, BRITISH AWAYS DIDNT WANT TO ACT ON IT WHEN I CONTACTED THEM WITH THE RIGHT DETAILS, THEY WANTED TO HEAR IT FROM THE 3RD PARTY COMPANY FIRST)\n\nThen it was to late, (I LOST OUT ON \u00a3470).\n\n",

I raised a complaint but have had no feedback or apology. After years of loyalty I have seen the service go downhill and the shabby aircraft, disinterested staff and poor arrivals service just sum up how I feel about BA these days. In a way, I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to explore other airlines.",
