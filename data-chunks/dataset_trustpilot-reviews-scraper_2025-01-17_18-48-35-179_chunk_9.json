    "reviewDescription": "The only gripe I have is their policy of hand luggage which is allowed in the cabin. Rather than pay for baggage allowance, which is charged seperately, more and more people are bringing ever larger suitcases onto the plane. As a result their is no room for traditonal hand luggage in overhead compartments so we had to fly with it under the seat in front which leaves no room for our legs to go which is an issue when you are 6ft+. BA, please find a solution to this as it makes flying in economy which is never that comfortable even worse.",

    "reviewDescription": "While traveling with a 3 year old baby and my husband, the baby was not allowed into the lounge with my husband\u2019s Gold card, as you can only bring one guest (I was plus 1). They said that the baby counts as another guest and can not enter! Ridiculous! It never happened with Emirates/ Qatar or any other airlines, so was a bit of the shock as we came earlier to feed the baby in the lounge.\n\nThe staff on board didn\u2019t help to lift the baby stroller to the hand luggage section explaining that they are not allowed to touch the bags, which is a lie. Again ALL other airlines staff were helping when I was traveling with a baby, even EasyJet!\n\nDuring the flight (in Premium Economy!) I was pushing the button to call for assistance (remove the food tray to go to the toilet with my baby) NO ONE CAME WITHIN 20 minutes (!!!). What if I felt sick or had an emergency??\n\nBA is probably the worst airline I have ever traveled with, the service is below the lowest standards and now with the new rewards system it doesn\u2019t make sense to use it at all.\n\nExpensive and very bad service!",
