    "reviewDescription": "This started with an email stating that my return flight from Barbados had been cancelled. No explanation and no offer of help. The advice was just check their website to rebook or claim a refund. Three weeks before I was supposed to fly out, a refund was of no use due to expensive accommodation bookings. The only flight on offer was 24 hours later. When rebooking, they even made me pay for seat selection again when I had already done this on the original booking. This was later refunded.\nOn my return home I lodged a claim for reimbursement of additional expenses, hotel. food and taxis but the website is not easy to navigate to find out what they pay and how to lodge the claim.\n10 weeks later the status of the claim is simply ''received'' in other words no-one has progressed the claim. 10 weeks of inaction.\nGeneral customer service cannot access the claims process, all they say is that the team are very busy. They cannot provide a contact number to speak to the team so the customer is left entirely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service and accountability.\nLike some of the other contributers, I think I have made my last booking with BA.\n",

    "reviewDescription": "Dear OWNERS of British Airlines\n\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding a recent experience with British Airways that I found to be quite disappointing.\n\nFlight BA 0552 of January 12, 2025\n\nIn my experience, the level of service provided was far below what one would expect from a reputable airline. Specifically, I encountered a significant delay during BA0552 flight, which was exacerbated by a lengthy crew replacement process that took two hours, followed by an additional 1.5 hours for flight attendant replacement.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, I found the staff to be unhelpful and, at times, rude. There was a notable lack of clear and honest communication regarding the reasons for the delay, leaving passengers feeling frustrated and uninformed.\n\nGiven these experiences, I regret to say that I no longer view British Airways as a premium airline. Instead, I perceive it to be more akin to a budget carrier in terms of service quality.\n\nI recommend that potential passengers consider using your airline only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nI would like particularly like to highlight the behaviour of Chief Flight Attendants MR. INCOGNITO who was especially rude and dismissive towards to passengers!\n\nI hope you take this feedback into consideration as you strive to improve your services.\nPassenger Seat 2A\n",

    "reviewTitle": "BA worst airline in the WORLD!!",
    "reviewDescription": "I want to understand why I can\u2019t rate the as 0. 1 is a huge overrating for this clown company. I was a gold card holder 7 years ago and would only fly BA. Last year they cancelled my return flight whilst on holiday with my whole family with 10 days notice. 6 months later they have just declined our compensation as we had to pay our \u00a32000 for replacement flights, extra nights accommodation, extra day car hire. Their reason: they cancelled the flight for \u2018Commercial Reasons\u2019!!!!! So why do I foot the bill for their commercial issues?!?!?! These clowns may think I will leave it here but rest assured I will take this to ombudsman followed by legal firms AND I will be claiming every single penny I am entitled too. I really hope that at some point a Class Action is brought against BA as you can read thousands of similar experiences online and they seem to get away with their inept customer service and ability to stress customers for 6-12 months as I can ill afford \u00a32000 on top of my holiday cost for reasons that an airline simply cancelled my flight and provided no alternative leaving me to book a replacement. The final point of note was that I booked a Vueling flight (which they told me they could not transfer me too as they had no agreement with the airline) AND wait for it, the payment on my statement for that flight went to BRITISH AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! \ud83e\udd21",

    "reviewTitle": "Very disappointing flight",
    "reviewDescription": "The staff were really arrogant, not friendly and engaging at all, it almost seems as if they just want to get you out of the way feed you and that's it. They did not engage cat all, asked if you wanted o eat and moved on, the male cabin crew that was serving in economy needs customer service training really. I asked for a drink and he said yes he will bring it, waited and waited after 20 minutes asked again from another cabin crew and also was told they will bring it, the flight ended and had still did not get my drink. I was very disappointed. This was my first time flying with British airways have never used him before and I fly at least 5 times a year for both business and lesure. Hope this was a once off and that this was just a bad day for the crew.\nThe food is really horrible especially after spending \u00a31800 on a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg i expected better much better for an airlines as big as British airways. The dinner i opened had a look and closed it straight away, went hungry and looked forward to breakfast. Then recieved the breakfast and did the same opened and closed it not good at all. A least i managed to eat the fruit.\nThe seat space is really uncomfortable, with theatre table beant the trays were sliding off.\nNot sure if anyone will call me the after care service normally never happens. My flight number was BA57 on 2nd January 2025.\n\nI am flying tonight again 12th January 2025 BA 56 hope his will be different after trying to upgrade my seat to a window seat and not able to, get to the end and dies not allowed me to make a payment and the seat was available. Eventually when I managed the seat was gone. Really disappointing.\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n",

Their customer service was exemplary, and their offerings were notably more competitive compared to British Airways.\n\n",

The first was over an hour late resulting in me being rebooked The second (which left before I arrived, but somehow carried one of my bags?) was an hour earlier than when I booked it. The third, due to a broken groundside air conditioner was also delayed, much of which saw me sweating my trecherous life away on a sweltering plane, that were it to just take off would be so much colder. The final flight was also a tad early, and was also missed due to a couple hours of delay.\n\nBeyond this, they lost my bag. Their website was repeatedly down due to \"high demandm,\" generally sluggish, and the section for tracking my bag was hidden through several confusingly titled links.\n\nBritish Airways desperately needs to get their act together, I have had worse experiences flying, but not many.\n\n",

Yes the plane flew, and yes we didn\u2019t die. But surely other parts of the service matter LIKE ANSWERING YOUR PHONE. Avoid BA like the plague.",

    "reviewTitle": "British Airways should leave the service industry",
    "reviewDescription": "We had a flight from Newcastle -> London -> Delhi with everything arranged, web checkin done and we booked good seats.\nDue to the first flight delay, we did not make the second flight. We were given a flight 7 hours later with separate middle seats, far apart from each other but this had a knock on effect of missing our hotel stay and car and driver that had been arranged in India.\nI was going to India for my wedding and missed my wedding dress fitting appointment also.\nWe were very upset and thought we would get a cup of tea as we both had headaches from the waiting and commotion but the queue at the cafe was so long that we decided to go to the BA lounge to sit down. I was feeling very dizzy and nauseated. My partner said to the receptionist called Av that if he could get the manager while we settle down.\nAv asked us for the tickets and then mocked us seeing the \u2018economy class\u2019 which was given to us as the only option by BA. I can\u2019t express my disgust at the way he smirked and let out a laugh seeing the tickets. When I confronted him, he asked me for further details which I did provide and added the issues I was facing due to a pounding headache to which his response was \u201care you going to answer me straight forward or not?\u201d. He threatened to take us off the flight several times if we didn\u2019t move.\nWe both collapsed on the floor near the door due to being drained of all this and bad head ache.\nThe manager Caroline Sawyer came and announced straight away that we should get up and leave ignoring our condition. They didn\u2019t ask us once about our health, they didn\u2019t care about spoiling my onward wedding plans which had to be all rearranged, they didn\u2019t care at all about spoiling my start of the beautiful journey for my destination wedding.\nInfact she threatened us to call the police and have us removed from the flight again and report at the gate to be monitored.\nWe left and went for a tea and sandwich. They had given us a voucher of \u00a310 each. The cost of two tea and one sandwich and two packets of crips came to \u00a320.95.\nAlthough we were going to wait 7hours, they didn\u2019t provide us water or any other comfort.\nBecause they only have a relationship with virgin Atlantic and air Canada. They would not put us on an afternoon flight on air India even though it was available.\nI wish I had not made this mistake of booking BA for my big day plan.\nIt\u2019s humiliating and embarrassing even to talk to them. They talk to you as if they are God and we are peasants. I think it\u2019s safe to say we had an experience of being with corporate bullies and in easier terms a dictatorship.\nTheir threats were appalling. Their treatment towards a sick person was deplorable. Their poor attitude added to my stress and caused me more dizziness.\nThey should leave the service industry.",

Than a get a completely horrible woman who says you won't back that flight gonand stand in this huge line. We said we can still make the original flight but she had her little bit of power and she was loving it. I said look can you just let us go and we can have a go at making this? She then said I was annoying her which really pleased me so she then call the security balloons. They asked what I was doing? I told them nothing speak to the head dispatcher as she seen herself. So now we have a 3hr wait while that person looks on laughing as of she has won't some big moral victory. She is noting bit a small slow minded individual who should be fires for her shocking service. I keep saying to more BAs BS and this time I'm done. I'll take KLM or American. They won't be worse than this shower of small minded morons. ADIOD BA after 30yrs",

    "reviewTitle": "An update and warning for those waiting for compensation and refunds from BA",
    "reviewDescription": "A further update to the one posted 2 days ago which will likely affect others waiting for compensation and refunds from BA.\nDue to a technical fault with the aircraft BA cancelled my flight from LHR to SFO on Dec 20th. This resulted in a 21 hour delay and a journey lasting over 40 hours.\nOK, things can go wrong when traveling, that\u2019s just part of experience if you travel often enough. When that happens, what is important is how the airline\u2019s customer services treat you. In this regard I\u2019ve been both shocked and appalled by BA\u2019s response.\nAfter trying 23 times over several days to contact BA Customer Services when I was repeatedly cut off by BA due them having a \u2018high call volume\u2019, I finally managed to speak to someone. The response I received was unbelievable.\nI asked about the status of my claim and why BA had not communicated anything to me and why BA had automatically closed my claim when I later checked the BA app. I was told \u201csorry I can\u2019t help you, that department is not operational at the moment\u201d. When I asked when it would be operational and how long it would take to process my claim, I was informed \u201csomeone from that department should contact you in the next 2 to 3 months\u201d. Not days, not weeks, months!\nWhen making a booking with BA they require immediate payment, when BA owes the customer money they take 3 months. I cannot even begin to comprehend the degree of contempt BA must have for its customers.\nI wish BA would have its landing slots at Heathrow revoked and given to a more competent operator. I\u2019m sure Virgin, Easy Jet or even Ryanair would do a much better job.\n",

However,I did ask for the difference in the cost between the two flights. Three months after my request and constant thanks for \u2018waiting for an answer,\u2019 I was told on Christmas Day that their records show I had been given a full refund.
