    "reviewDescription": "I've been a loyal Avios customer for years + have a BA Amex card.\n\nI've put BA on my blacklist for the following reason:\n\n1. I had earned a companion voucher through my spend. I tried to book a flight with this voucher but there was a problem with their Executive Club portal. The voucher subsequently expired & when I asked that they allow me to use it, they refused on 2 different occasions.\n\n2. Their Avios scheme doesn't adequately reward loyalty - you lose tiers if you don't fly with BA for a period of time.\n\nIn view of my spend, I am sorely disappointed with the lack of loyalty I've received back from BA particularly when their IT system prohibited me from using the companion voucher I had earned through my spend.\n\nIt is for that reason, BA is on my blacklist and I will not fly with them for the foreseeable.",

    "reviewTitle": "Flying back from Schipol in The\u2026",
    "reviewDescription": "Flying back from Schipol in The Netherlands to London City. I got to the airport a few hours early, went to the BA check-in desk, and asked if I could change to one of the two flights before the one I am booked on, and how much would it cost to switch. Same departure and arrival airports. I was told that couldn't even look into that for me, and I needed to call a BA customer service number. When did airlines decide that you couldn't even discuss the simplest of changes to travel plans in person at the airport? So, I called BA, eventually got through to an agent, explained what I was looking to do and asked for the the price to change. After a few minutes checking he told me that yes, I could switch to the earliest available flight. As he didn't tell me how much I assumed it would be free, or a minimal charge. After another five minutes he had successfully moved me to the earliest flight, then informed me it would cost \u00a3139, which is essentially the cost of buying a new ticket. Memo to BA - as part of your customer service training, if there is such a thing, have the agents inform the passenger of any price implications before changing the booking, not after. I said I didn't want to proceed at that cost, he told me he had in the meantime removed me from my original flight, so I would have to re-check in at the airport desk. I went back to the desk, and was told my entire booking had been cancelled, and that I was \"no longer travelling\". After I expressed my disappointment at that particular nugget of information, a supervisor came over and eventually I was back to where I started, with a ticket for my original flight. Only half an hour of my time wasted, with some unnecessary annoyance. I subsequently went to the boarding gate to see if I could be allowed on one of the earlier flights, and was told this was \"not possible\". I am quite sure it is possible, BA just actively hates their customers, and rather than allowing for a simple accommodation, that would inconvenience literally no one, and would mean I got home to my family two hours early, they chose to say no. Well done BA, really well done. Alex Henderson BA member (for now) 40780277",

    "reviewDescription": "We had a BA overnight flight to and from Heathrow to Johannesburg (out Dec 24 back Jan 25) and it was a complete nightmare. Both planes were filled with business class seats with economy crammed in at the final third of the plane, the space allocated to an economy seat is abysmal, so uncomfortable and a tight squeeze getting in and out, even when empty of people! The seats hardly recline and are more uncomfortable when reclined but the worst part is the seat itself, no padding at all, I suffer from sciatica but even my husband who does not found the seats impossible they were so hard with no padding. This is not acceptable on such a long flight. I was in agony on both flights. The cabin was so warm and on this plane those adjustable tiny fans above your head do not exist. The food too was horrible, pasta with tomato sauce only! The worst bit however was the return flight, we landed (with numerous excuses from the captain about a fault on the plane which personally I find scary) only to be left sitting on the boiling hot plane for a further 1.5 hours because there were no bus drivers to take us from the plane to the terminal. Our flight cost more than \u00a31100 each, we will never fly BA again.",

ALL of the staff were in a good mood and so polite and helpful. Diego gave me some recommendations of where to go and what to eat in Madrid. I was taking my friend to Madrid as she had turned 50 two days before and I told the cabin staff this and they opened us a bottle of champagne and gave it to us for free, in glasses. They made sure we was happy throughout and my friend and I thought it was such a lovely touch (we were only in economy) that it really set the mood for our trip. So thank you to Diego, Olivia and I think her name was Nahum for looking after us at the back. Also to Gary who came to see us at the end of our flight and shook our hands. Its not often airline staff get praise but we felt they deserved it.",
